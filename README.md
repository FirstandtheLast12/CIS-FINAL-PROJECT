# CIS-FINAL-PROJECT
All code changes made here for the walmart dataset

In your final project, you are asked to conduct a business analytics project using Python. The purpose of this final project is for you to apply all the conceptual and practical knowledge that you learn in the course. 



Your final project report must include the following elements:



1) Summary
2) Descriptive Analytics
3) redictive Analytics
4) Findings


~ The code that you develop for your final project and the data must be submitted here in blackboard alongside your final project report. If you have multiple code files, submit a zip file



You must include all information necessary (e.g., comments, URLs, documentation) to replicate your work. Failure to include information that allows the replication of your work will result in grade penalties and, depending on the case, can be considered a potential violation of the honor code. All code you submit should be your own or include a commentary in which you disclose the source of the code. Students who submit plagiarized code will be reported to the honor system.



*Recommendations*


 Be organized in your submission. Keep your work organized with titles and subtitles.
 Label all visualizations and tables.
 In your commentary, refer to your visualizations and tables.
 Do not include visualizations or tables that you are not referring to in your commentary. 
 In your commentaries, be brief and to the point.
 Only include the most important visualizations and tables in your report.
 Remember that you must explain your analysis in your final project. Do not expect the instructor to figure it out.
 Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep should be complementary. Your work should be mostly done in Python.
